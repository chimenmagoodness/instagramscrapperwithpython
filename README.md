Title: Instagram Hashtag Scraper

Description:
This Python script uses the instaloader library to scrape Instagram posts based on a list of hashtags provided by the user. It prompts the user to input the number of hashtags to search for and the hashtags themselves. It then loops through the specified hashtags, retrieves posts for each hashtag, and prints information about the posts, including the post's ID, date, caption, likes, and comments. Additionally, it downloads the media associated with each post to a directory named after the corresponding hashtag.
